How we tested our client and server:
1. We tested the Ping-Pong mode of our client and server by starting the server and then invoke the client with various
    message sizes and counts. We also tested edges cases such as sending only 1 message of size 10 and sending 10000 
    messages of size 65535.
2. We tested the Web server mode of our client by ... TODO FINISH THIS PART
3. We tested the Measurement part of the server client by running several test cases on clear.

There is no known problem.

Anything the grader needs to know:
