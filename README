For Ping Pong mode, we tested cases in which single client connecting to one
server and multiple clients connecting to one server. We also tested multiple
combinations of different message sizes and counts. For example, we tested 
messages of size 65535 bytes and send them 10000 times, messages of a small
size and send them 10000 times, etc. 
For Web Server mode, besides testing our client and server under the general
case, we also tested them under special cases such as when client sends an 
absolute path, our server can send back the requested file (if such file
exists) and when the client requests a file that does not exist or uses path
that contains "../", our server will give the corresponding error codes.

There are no problems with our client and server as far as we know.
